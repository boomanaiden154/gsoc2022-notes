# Work Planning

Some TODO items that I still need to get done.

* [ ] Implement a SPDX parser for the dataset tooling/Spack
* [ ] Experiment with the normalization strategy for code-size prediction
* [ ] Experiment with L1 vs L2 loss for code-size prediction
* [ ] Experiment with using MCAD as a cost model for MLRegalloc
* [ ] Upstream the MLGO log reader
* [ ] Update the llvm testing guide
* [ ] Add license infoot spack packages.io
* [ ] Add a config file in Spack for licenses/redistribution info
* [ ] Make spack package audit parse license info
* [ ] Write a script to pull the size distribution from the dataset for code-size prediction
* [ ] Fix issues/reland the `std::string_view` SmallString conversion.
* [ ] Move the code format job into a container
* [ ] Plan improvements to llvm-tokenizer, implement them
* [ ] Add MLGO libs to llvm-config (Fixes github issue floating somewhere)
* [ ] Add support for llvm-cm reading the PGO address map
* [ ] Make llvm-cm use ExitonErr
* [ ] Initial Gentoo builder implementation
* [ ] Initial Fortran builder implementation
* [ ] Implement linux LLVM threading primitives/switch to using them
* [ ] Add a workflow to delete stale branches in the monorepo
* [ ] Add tests for git clang-format
* [ ] Refactor runBenchmarkConfiguration (kind of forgetting why I wanted this now)
* [ ] Document mlgo-utils
* [ ] Document LLVM CI best practices
* [ ] Discourse ComPile post
* [ ] Delete IR2Native
* [ ] Dataset exclusion information (licensing)
* [ ] Convert code formatting job to `pull_request` target
* [ ] Code formatting slash command
* [ ] Cleanup yaml2obj docs
* [ ] Upload built docs as artifacts
* [ ] llvm-ranlib test debugging that is failing on LLNL systems
* [ ] Private email check job fail and add single comment
* [ ] Refactor docs job to not need so much duplication.
