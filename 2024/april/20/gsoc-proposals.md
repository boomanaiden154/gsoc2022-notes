# GSOC Proposal ranking

### Proposal 1

* Whether the project would contribute to LLVM and be useful
  * Score: 2/2
  * Already contributing to the project, community has been given the go-ahead
  to work on upstreaming. Almost certainly will end up in upstream LLVM, and
  there seems to be a consensus that the broader area of work is useful to
  the community.
* Can the result be integrated to the mainline after the completion of GSoC
  * Score: 2/2 (see above)
* Scope of the project, if it would contribute to some narrow or broad topic
  * Score: 1.5/2 - Would be somewhat narrow, and would be work on a broader area
  that is currently experimental.
* The background of the student, including history of LLVM contributions
  * Score: 2/2 - Has contributed previously.
* The viability of the project, how accurate the plan, timeline, etc. are
  * Score: 1.5/2 - Timeline seems reasonable enough. It's hard to tell how things
  will pan out, especially with hard-to-predict variables like code reviews/RFCs,
  but the outline of work seems appropriate. There is no discussion of work done
  during the community bonding period. The contributor already seems fairly well
  integrated with the LLVM community, but some mention of it (or doing something
  like iterating on design documents) might have improved the proposal slightly.

### Proposal 2

* Whether the project would contribute to LLVM and be useful
  * Score: 2/2 - This project would definitely help the upstream project.
  I'm not too familiar with the specific problem area, but the motivation
  does outline specific problems that other members of the community have
  run into.
* Can the result be integrated to the mainline after the completion of GSoC
  * Score: 2/2 - Yes, I would expect the results to be relatively easy to
  integrate into upstream.
* Scope of the project, if it would contribute to some narrow or broad topic
  * Score: 1.5/2 - This is a fairly narrow scope, but something that is still
  quite useful, and a reasonable scope for a GSoC project. There are a couple
  specific action items that are relatively small, but should definitely
  improve the state of things in the area the proposal discusses.
* The background of the student, including history of LLVM contributions
  * Score: 1/2 - The student does not provide any background in the proposal
  (other than a section on personal motivation) and does not seem to have
  upstreamed any patches previously.
* The viability of the project, how accurate the plan, timeline, etc. are
  * Score: 2/2 - The project seems reasonably scoped and the timeline seems
  reasonable. It's very hard to predict exactly how the timeline will play
  out, but the deliverables seem reasonable. Code review hasn't been factored
  in, but that should be easy to do in parallel with other things.

### Proposal 3

* Whether the project would contribute to LLVM and be useful
  * Score - 2/2
  * This project would definitely be useful to LLVM. There are certain features
  clang needs to support in the future that this work would be useful for, along
  with other subprojects, and it would help make the specific subproject more
  flexible, which will probably be good with increased interest in the area of
  the proposal.
* Can the result be integrated to the mainline after the completion of GSoC
  * Score: 2/2 - Yes, the results can easily be integrated to the mainline,
  and can be done so continually through the GSoC process.
* Scope of the project, if it would contribute to some narrow or broad topic
  * Score: 1/2 - The project is scoped appropriately (in my opinion), but
  the proposal deviates a little bit from the project and includes additional
  things that broaden the scope of work, seemingly unncessarily.
* The background of the student, including history of LLVM contributions
  * Score: 1/2 - The student has a couple of PRs open/landed fixing some
  beginner issues. They offer no other background in the proposal, other than
  mentioning they have done some related reading.
* The viability of the project, how accurate the plan, timeline, etc. are
  * Score 0.5/2 - There seem to be some methodology issues with some of the
  steps in the timeline (like some weird tool choices), it's very non-specific,
  and also somewhat brief.
