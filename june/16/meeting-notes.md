# Meeting Notes 6/16/2022

* Build LLVM test suite with profiling (should be automation in CMake)
* Should be some benchmarking tooling in the ml-compiler-opt repository,
but will probably need to be modified. Probably only good to use as an
example.
* Look at cycles as a performance counter as well.
* Building the corpus using PGO would also be a good idea.
* Initial model probably won't have very high performance.
