# Meeting Notes 4/14/2023

* GSoC Stuff
* Exegesis patches
  * Any alternative to an asm test harness? Inline assembly probably still
  won't cover most of the things we need.
  * Any updates on GRANITE tooling in relation to this?
    * Application to profile memory accesses of arbitrary BBs
* Other updates for GRANITE?
  * Scripts for extraction of BBs using `SHT_LLVM_BB_ADDR_MAP`
* Packaging GRANITE as a Python library for consumption in MLGO?
* Upstream patches in `ml-compiler-opt` for alternative reward generation
for regalloc?
