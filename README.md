# GSOC-2022 Notes

This repository contains a lot of my notes regarding LLVM and machine learning
in compilers. I started it while doing GSoC during 2022 but still ocassionally
use the repository.

## Organization

All of the notes that I took during 2022 are in the folders named after the
months they were taken in. I'm not planning on changing this as some of
them are linked to from other sites (like the GSoC) page and I'd prefer not
to break those.

Everything after that is in its separate year folder (e.g., all notes from
2023 are in the `/2023` folder).
